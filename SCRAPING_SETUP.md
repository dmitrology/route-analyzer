# RouteDeals Real Scraping Setup

## ✅ Real Scraping Implementation Complete!

Your RouteDeals application now has **REAL scraping functionality** implemented according to the PRD specifications:

### 🚀 What's Implemented

- **✅ Skyscanner Flight Scraping**: Full implementation with anti-bot measures
- **✅ Booking.com Hotel Scraping**: 3-5 star hotels with price ordering  
- **✅ Anti-Bot Protection**: Random delays, user agent rotation, stealth browsing
- **✅ Robust Error Handling**: 3x retry logic with exponential backoff
- **✅ Screenshot Debugging**: Auto-captures screenshots on errors in development
- **✅ Fallback Selectors**: Multiple selector strategies for reliability

### 🔧 Environment Setup

To enable proxy-based scraping (recommended for production), add these to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# SmartProxy Configuration (or your preferred proxy service)
PROXY_SERVER=rotating-residential.smartproxy.com:8000
PROXY_USERNAME=your_smartproxy_username  
PROXY_PASSWORD=your_smartproxy_password

# Development flag (enables debug screenshots)
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 🎯 Testing the Scraping

You can test the real scraping functionality:

1. **Manual Test**: Use the Convex dashboard to run scraping actions:
   - Go to https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/sleek-sockeye-75
   - Navigate to "Functions" 
   - Run `scrapers:scrapeAndSaveFlight` with test parameters:
     ```json
     {
       "origin": "JFK",
       "dest": "MCO", 
       "date": "2025-06-15"
     }
     ```

2. **Without Proxy** (for testing): Scraping will work without proxy but may be rate-limited
3. **With Proxy** (recommended): Add proxy credentials to `.env.local` for production use

### 📊 Monitoring

- Real scraping results will show in your RouteDeals dashboard
- Check the "Live Price Monitoring" section for success/error counts
- Logs available in Convex dashboard under your functions

### 🏗️ Next Steps According to PRD

1. **Add Proxy Service**: Sign up for SmartProxy or similar residential proxy service
2. **Set Up Cron Jobs**: The PRD specifies daily scraping schedules:
   - Flights: Daily at 04:00 ET
   - Hotels: Daily at 05:00 ET
3. **Analytics Functions**: Implement Holt-Winters baseline calculations
4. **Deal Detection**: Add the "🔥 BOOK NOW" badge logic (deltaPct ≥ 0.15 AND rarity ≤ 0.1)

### 📋 Outstanding PRD Decisions Needed

Please decide on these thresholds:

1. **Refund threshold** – auto refund if final cost rises by > $?
2. **Book-or-Wait badge** – show to guests before login?
3. **Add-ons** – include car rental later?
4. **Support channel** – email only or chat widget?
5. **Legal ToS comfort** – confirm "derived-data OK" stance
