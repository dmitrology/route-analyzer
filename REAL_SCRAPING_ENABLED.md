# 🎉 RouteDeals: Real Scraping Successfully Implemented!

## ✅ Achievement Summary

**Status**: Real Playwright scraping is now **FULLY WORKING** with **ZERO BUNDLING ISSUES**! 🚀

### 🔧 Technical Solution: External Packages

We solved the persistent Chromium bundling errors by using **Convex External Packages**:

```json
{
  "node": {
    "externalPackages": [
      "playwright",
      "playwright-core", 
      "playwright-stealth",
      "chromium-bidi"
    ]
  }
}
```

This approach:
- ✅ Eliminates bundling conflicts
- ✅ Enables real Playwright automation  
- ✅ Maintains Convex serverless benefits
- ✅ Auto-installs packages on server
